\title{Summarise Global Depth Averages and Standard Deviations from cGENIE NetCDF Data}
\usage{
cGENIE.depth.sum(var, experiment, year = "default", model = "biogem")
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{A character string specifying the variable name to extract from the NetCDF file (e.g., "ocn_O2").}

\item{experiment}{A character string indicating the path to the cGENIE experiment directory.}

\item{year}{A character string or numeric value specifying the year to extract. Default is "default" which selects the last time step.}

\item{model}{A character string indicating the model type (default is "biogem").}
}
\value{
A dataframe with summarized mean and standard deviation of the variable grouped by depth ranges.
}
\description{
This function extracts and processes a 3D variable from a cGENIE NetCDF file.
It computes the mean and standard deviation for the variable at different depth levels,
grouped by depth ranges.
}
\details{
The function reads the specified 3D variable from the NetCDF file, groups the data by depth, and calculates summary statistics (mean and standard deviation). The depth is grouped by minimum and maximum depth edges.
}
